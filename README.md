# Java - Google 

This repository contains homeworks and materials provided during  the [Google Digital Garage Java](https://events.withgoogle.com/atelierul-digital-pentru-programatori/cursuri/#content) programme.

The course comprised of a series of introductory to advanced topics regarding Java and OOP:
- OOP principles
- Collections
- Generics
- Concurrency
- Reflection
- Functional programming (Java Streams API)
- Design Patterns
- SOLID
